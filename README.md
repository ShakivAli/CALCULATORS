# CALCULATORS
a whole bunch of calculators consists from simple addition to angular momentum, truss and many more.. 

INTRODUCTION:-
--------------
This is a little bit introduction to my project known as “calculators”. As name suggests, it is basically a whole bunch of different calculators. In this project I basically taken my 1st  year of college as a reference, where I have implement “c” programming language  knowledge to perform calculations which I had done in my first year of college. So, obviously it doesn’t cover everything from 1st year, but I try my best to make a simple but helpful project and it’s also helps me in brushing up my “c” programming language concepts which I had learned in initial days of my college.

HOW IT WILL HELP?
-----------------
Most of the students learns about basics of mechanics and electronics in their first year of college and solve problems of that. In some topics it takes too much time while solving questions and if we solve questions ourselves, we didn’t confirm about the answer we are getting.
So, in such a scenario this project will help in getting your correct answers right away from the topics which are listed in the main screen of compiler.
It saves time plus it is user friendly. I try to make it look aligned as much as I can to avoid confusions and try to give indications and messages in between to make it more crystal clear.
